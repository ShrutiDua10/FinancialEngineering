Predicting returns using deep learning models such as LSTM/GRU have been explored but I don't believe they are as reliable just yet in a live trading system. 
I will be retrying models used in published papers comparing results and possibly combining established methods to procure a good deep learning model that can be incorporated in algotrading.
